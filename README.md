A web deployable applicaiton that allows you to quickly design and visualize your [Finnhub Stock API data](https://finnhub.io/) in a [dashboard format](https://github.com/GlennStreetman/finnHub-Dashboard/blob/master/public/Example_small.jpg). Each dashboard then becomes its own API endpoint that you can query using graphQL. After you are done designing your dashboards you can push your data to Excel.

[Working Example](https://finn-dash.herokuapp.com/) requires going through registration process and working Finnhub.io API Key.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Backend uses [Express Server](https://expressjs.com).  
User Login info and dashboard data is saved in a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org).  
Required Postgres schema should auto build the first time express is launched. 
The registration process requires that express have access to an SMTP server in order to send registration emails. Recommend Mailgun.  
Register a [Mailgun Account](https://www.mailgun.com/) and add your apikeys to the .env setup below.

## .env setup

### FOR LOCAL HOSTING:  
API_KEY = mailgun api key  
DOMAIN_KEY = mailgun domain  
session_secret = secret phrase used for express-session management. KEEP SECRET.  
pguser = postgres user name  
pghost = postgres host name  
pgpassword = postgress password  
pgdatabase = postgres database name  
pgport = postress server port  
devDB = PG <--SQLite3 support depricated. Some work needed for SQL3 tag to work  
ssl = allow  
mongo = connection string for mongo db. ex: mongodb://localhost:27017  
URL = URL for dev environment. ex: http://localhost:5000  
db_verison = 1.0  

### FOR HEROKU Hosting + Heroku Postgres addon:  
API_Key: mailgun api key  
DATABASE_URL: Database URL provided by Heroku  
DOMAIN_KEY: mailgun domain  
live: 1  
session_secret: secret phrase used for express-session management. KEEP SECRET.  
db_verison = 1.0

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run client`

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Runs the express server in development mode.<br />
Send HTTP requests [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to test routes.

### `npm start`

    Run the build/live version, app is returned from express server.

### `npm run build`
